# 3D Knit and Woven Garment Designs

This repository showcases my professional work in digital fashion using **CLO 3D**. I specialize in creating high-fidelity simulations for both Knit and Woven apparel.

## 🧵 Key Expertise
- **Knitwear:** Specialized in realistic jersey, fleece, and ribbing simulations with accurate fabric physics.
- **Woven Apparel:** Focused on precise pattern making for denim, twill, and poplin garments including complex detailing.
- **Technical Skills:** Pattern construction, 3D draping, and high-quality rendering.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **CLO 3D** (Pattern making & Simulation)
- **Adobe Illustrator** (Graphics & Layout)
- **GitHub** (Project Documentation)
